# RBSDigitalApproaches
This repository collects various scraps of code related to the Rare Book School class L-100 (Digital Approaches to Bibliography and Book History) in particular, and to assorted points of biblionerdery, more generally.

As will probably be clear from a quick glance at the bits and bobs you'll see here, I'm a practitioner of what could charitably be called punk rock coding: I don't always know what I'm doing, but try to make a noise anyhow. (If you actually do know what you're doing, you may well see things here that will leave you shaking your head and whistling through your teeth.)

If you see something you think you can use, please feel free. If you have questions, get in touch and I'll try to answer them, but can't guarantee that I'll know the answers myself.
